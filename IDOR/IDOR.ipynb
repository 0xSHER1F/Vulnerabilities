    "# **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) :**\n",
    "\n",
    " * **```IDOR is a subclass of access control vulnerabilities, where an attacker can access, modify, or delete resources by manipulating the input parameters that directly reference objects (like files, records, or database entries) without proper authorization checks```**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * **How IDORs Work ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Apps uses predictable identifiers (user IDs, file paths) to access resources, Attacker can manipulates the identifier in the URL or form data to access unauthorized resources, Then application fails to validate or sanitize the user-supplied input, allowing the attacker to access the requested resource\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Assume There is a URL for accessing user profile data **```https://example.com/profile?id=1```** , Where **```id=1```** is the unique identifier for the user's profile \n",
    "\n",
    "     * If the application doesn't validate that the requesting user is allowed to access this profile, an attacker might change the **```id```** parameter to another value, such as **```id=2```**, and access someone else's profile data\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Ways to Get IDORs :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **URL Manipulation :** Changing the URL parameter to access restricted data, as shown in The Previous Example \n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Form Field Manipulation :**  Altering hidden form fields that reference an object, such as changing a form's product ID to another value during checkout\n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **API Manipulation :** API might allow users to perform actions on specific resources by referencing an object ID in the request. If the API doesnâ€™t validate the user's access rights, it can be exploited via IDOR\n",
    "\n",
    "     4) **File Reference :** Accessing or modifying a file by guessing or changing the file path or name in the request URL or body\n",

    " 1) **Proper Input Validation :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Always validate and sanitize user-supplied input to prevent attackers from manipulating identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    " 2) **Use Secure Identifiers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Use unpredictable or encrypted identifiers to make it difficult for attackers to guess or manipulate them\n",
    "\n",
    " 3) **Implement Access Control Checks :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Validate user permissions before allowing access to any object. Ensure that the user is authorized to access or modify the requested object\n",
