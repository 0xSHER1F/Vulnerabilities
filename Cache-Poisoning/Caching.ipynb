    "# **Caching :**\n",
    "\n",
    " * **the process of storing copies of web resources (like HTML pages, images, and scripts) in a temporary storage area ```(cache)``` to improve website performance**\n",
    "\n",
    " * When a user requests a resource, the cache is checked first. If the resource is found in the cache, it's served from there, bypassing the origin server and significantly reducing load times\n",
    "\n",
    " * **How Web Caching Works ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Requesting Resources :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * User requests a web page from a web server\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Cache Checking :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * Caching server checks its local cache for the requested resource   \n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **Cache HIT :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * If the resource is found in the cache, it's served directly to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "     4) **Cache MISS :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * If the resource isn't in the cache, the request is forwarded to the origin server \n",
    "\n",
    "     5) **Caching :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * The fetched resource is stored in the cache for future requests, optimizing subsequent access\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Caching Servers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Store copies of frequently accessed web content,They act as intermediaries between clients (users) and origin servers (where the original content is stored)  \n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Caching Servers Types :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         1) **Web Proxies :** These act as intermediaries between clients and origin servers, caching web pages and other content, \n",
    "          \n",
    "             * Examples : Squid, Nginx, and Varnish   \n",
    "\n",
    "         2) **CDNs :** vast network of servers geographically distributed to deliver content quickly , CDNs excel at serving static content like images, videos, and CSS files \n",
    "\n",
    "         3) **Reverse Proxies :** While primarily used for load balancing, reverse proxies also cache content.\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Examples : Nginx and HAProxy \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Caching Key :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Unique identifier used to store and retrieve cached data\n",
    "\n",
    "     * It's essentially the fingerprint of a specific piece of content within a cache\n",
    "\n",
    "     * When a user requests a resource, the caching server calculates a caching key based on various request parameters :\n",
    "\n",
    "         * If a matching key exists in the cache, the cached content is served\n",
    "\n",
    "         * otherwise, the content is fetched from the origin server and stored with the newly calculated key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Caching Key Components :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         1) **URL :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * The complete URL of the requested resource, including the path and query parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "         2) **HTTP Method :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         3) **Headers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Certain HTTP headers, such as ```Accept```, ```Cookie```, or ```User-Agent```, can be included in the caching key to differentiate requests  \n",
    "\n",
    "         4) **Query String :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Parameters in the URL's query string can influence the caching key\n",
    "\n",
    "         5) **Custom Parameters :** \n",
    "         \n",
    "             * Some caching systems allow you to define custom parameters to include in the caching key               \n",
    "\n",
    " * **Unkeyed Headers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * HTTP headers that are not included in the calculation of a caching key, their values don't affect whether a cached response is served or not\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Unkeyed headers is a potential risk for exploitation in web **cache poisoning attacks** :\n",
    "\n",
    "         * By manipulating unkeyed headers, an attacker can craft malicious requests that are cached and served to other users\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Common Unkeyed Headers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **X-Forwarded-For :** used by proxies to identify the original client IP address, but it's often not included in caching keys \n",
    "\n",
    "         * **X-Forwarded-Host :**\n",
