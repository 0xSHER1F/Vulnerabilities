    "     1) **Identifying Unkeyed Headers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Attackers exploit unkeyed headers (headers not considered for cache key generation) to manipulate cache behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "                 * Any custom headers added to requests might be unkeyed by default unless explicitly configured (depending on the caching server and its configuration) \n",

    "\n",
    "         * Crafting requests with specific unkeyed header values, the attacker can induce the origin server to generate a response containing malicious content \n",

    "\n",
    "         * The attacker's malicious response is cached by the caching server due to identical cache keys\n",

    "# **Web Cache Deception :**\n",
    "\n",
    " * **attack where an attacker tricks a web cache into storing sensitive, dynamic content that should not be cached. This is often achieved by manipulating the URL structure or exploiting misconfigurations in the caching server**\n",

    "     \n",

    "     \n",
    "         * The attacker can then retrieve the cached content, potentially exposing sensitive information\n",

    " * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Consider a dynamic web page, ```www.example.com/profile.php```, that displays a user's profile information . This page is not intended to be cached due to its dynamic nature\n",
    "\n",
    "     * attacker might construct a URL like this ```www.example.com/profile.php/nonexistent.js``` :\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Since ```.js``` typically represents a static file, the caching server might store the entire content of the profile page under the key associated with ```.js```\n",
    "\n",
    "         * if the application is replaying with the sensitive user contents stored in ```www.example.com/profile.php```, you can steal those contents from other users\n",
