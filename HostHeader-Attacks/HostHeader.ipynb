    "\n",
    " * **What is The Host Header ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * ```Piece of information sent by a Client (web browser) to The Server , It specifies the domain name (or IP address) of the website the client is trying to reach```\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * if You Are Trying to Visit ```https://www.example.com``` , The Browser Sends an HTTP Request With a Host Header set to ```www.example.com``` , Which tells the SErver to deliver the Content for that specific Domain \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Nowadays multiple websites/applications can be accessible at the same IP address , this is most commonly a result of one of the following scenarios : \n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Virtual Hosting :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * the technique of hosting multiple websites on a single server using the same IP address.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         * This is made possible by the use of the **Host header** in HTTP requests\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **How it Works ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "             1) **DNS Resolution :** \n",
    "             \n",
    "                 * When a user enters a domain name (https://www.example.com) into their browser, the DNS resolves it to the server's IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "             2) **HTTP Request :** \n",
    "              \n",
    "                 * The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, including the Host header  that specifies the desired domain name (www.example.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "             3) **Server Configuration :** \n",
    "              \n",
    "                 * The server is configured to recognize multiple domain names. It uses the **Host header** information to determine which website to serve\n",
    "\n",
    "             4) **Content Delivery :** The server processes the request and sends the appropriate content based on the **Host header** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Imagine a server with the IP address 1.1.1.1 hosting The Following websites :  \n",
    "\n",
    "                 1) www.example.com\n",
    "                 2) www.website.com\n",
    "\n",
    "             * When a user visits ```www.example.com``` , their browser sends a request to **1.1.1.1** with a **Host header** of ```\"www.example.com\"``` . The server then serves the content for that specific domain \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Routing Traffic via an Intermediary :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * In some cases, traffic for multiple domains might be routed through an intermediary server **[ Load Balancer - Reverse Proxy ]** before reaching the final destination. This is often used for load balancing, content delivery networks (CDNs), or security purposes  \n",

    "             \n",
    "                 * The DNS resolves the domain name to the IP address of the intermediary server   \n",
    "\n",
    "             2) **Traffic Forwarding :** \n",
    "             \n",
    "                 * The intermediary server receives the request and forwards it to the appropriate backend server based on configuration rules, load balancing algorithms, or other criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "             3) **Content Delivery :** \n",
    "             \n",
    "                 * The backend server processes the request and sends the content back to the intermediary server, which then forwards it to the client  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Imagine You Have The Following :\n",
    "\n",
    "                 1) **Domains :** [ www.example.com - www.website.com ]\n",
    "\n",
    "                 2) **Intermediary Server :** [ Load Balancer - Reverse Proxy ] with IP address 10.0.0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "                 3) **Backend Servers :** Server A (192.0.0.1), Server B (192.0.0.2) \n",
    "\n",
    "             * When a user visits ```www.example.com``` , the request is sent to the **load balancer (10.0.0.1)** . The load balancer directs the traffic to **Server A**, which serves the content for ```www.example.com```                                          \n",

    " * ```Host header attacks exploit vulnerabilities in how web applications handle the Host header value If an application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the Host header, attackers can manipulate it to their advantage```\n",

    " * **Common Host header attacks :**\n",

    "     1) **Web cache poisoning :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * This involves injecting malicious content into a web cache, which can then be served to other users \n",

    "     2) **Business logic flaws :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Attackers can potentially bypass authentication mechanisms or access restricted functionality by manipulating the Host header \n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **Routing-based SSRF :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * By controlling the Host header, attackers might be able to redirect requests to unintended servers, potentially leading to data exposure or unauthorized access  \n",

    "\n",
    "     4) **Classic server-side vulnerabilities :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * The Host header, like any other user-controlled input, can be a vector for classic vulnerabilities like SQL injection if not properly sanitized  \n",

    "     5) **Password reset poisoning :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Attackers can manipulate the Host header in password reset requests to redirect the reset link to a malicious site           \n",

    "\n",
    " * **How to prevent HTTP Host header attacks ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Validate and sanitize Host headers :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Always verify the validity of the Host header and escape any untrusted input\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Avoid using Host header for URL construction :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Instead, use relative URLs or hardcode the domain name \n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **Set the Host header explicitly :** *\n",
    "     \n",
    "         * If you must use the Host header, set its value explicitly instead of relying on the user-provided value   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     4) **Consider using a whitelist of allowed Host header values :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Restrict the allowed Host header values to a predefined list \n",
    "\n",
    "     5) **Don't support Host override headers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * do not support additional headers that may be used to construct these attacks \n",
