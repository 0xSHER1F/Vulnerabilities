    " * >**Why Does it Happens ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) Trusting User's inputs, this User may be an Attacker and submits malicious code as input\n",

    "     2) Bad Validations & Sanitizing to User's input , allowing the malicious code to be stored or reflected back to the user\n",

    " * >**Types Of XSS :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Reflected XSS :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Malicious code is sent to the website and immediately reflected back to the user, The application takes in user input, processes it server-side, and immediately returns it to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "         * The attacker tricks the victim into clicking a link or visiting a page containing the reflected code \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Stored XSS :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Malicious code is permanently stored on the website's server (in DB) and any user visiting the affected page will be vulnerable \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **DOM-Based XSS :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Malicious code manipulates the DOM of a web page after it's loaded  \n",
    "\n",
    "         * similar to reflected XSS, except that in DOM-based XSS, the user input never leaves the user’s browser. In DOM-based XSS, the application takes in user input, processes it on the victim’s browser **(Client-Server)** and then returns it to the user  \n",
    "\n",
    "     4) **Blind XSS :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Malicious code is stored on the server, but the attacker cannot directly see its execution. The execution happens at a different time or location within the application, making it \"blind\" to the attacker  \n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * **Admin Panel :**      \n",
    "\n",
    "                 * attacker injects malicious code into a public form, but the script only executes when an administrator views that data in their dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     5) **Self XSS :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * only affects the victim who injects the malicious code   \n",
    "\n",
    "         * Attacker tricks the victim into submitting the malicious script, which then executes within the victim's own browser            \n",

    "     2) Output Escaping and Encoding **(Sanitizing)** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Escaping :** refers to the practice of encoding special characters so that they are interpreted literally instead of as a special character by the programs or machines that process the characters\n",
    "\n",
    "     3) choosing the right JavaScript framework to use    \n",
    "\n",
    "     4) Set the **HttpOnly** flag on sensitive cookies that your site uses, Which prevents attackers from stealing those cookies via XSS\n",
    "\n",
    "     5) Implement the Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header, which restrict how resources such as JavaScript, CSS, or images load on your web pages\n",
