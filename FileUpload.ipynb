    "     2) The server processes the file, which may involve validating, renaming, moving, or storing it in a specific location, file is stored on the server, in a database, or in a cloud storage system\n",
    "     3) The file may be accessed later by the user or other users, or it may be used by the server  \n",

    "\n",
    "         * Specifies the MIME type of the file being uploaded\n",
    "\n",
    "         * server uses this information to understand the type of file being uploaded and to enforce restrictions on allowed file types\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :** ```Content-Type: image/jpeg```\n",
