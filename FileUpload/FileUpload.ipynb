    "\n",
    " * **```Feature allows users to upload files from their local device to a web server, such as images, documents, or other types of data```**\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Most Important File Uploading Process :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) User Selects a file from their local system and submits it through the application's interface , then file is sent to the server, typically through an HTTP POST request\n",
    "     2) The server processes the file, which may involve validating, renaming, moving, or storing it in a specific location, file is stored on the server, in a database, or in a cloud storage system\n",
    "     3) The file may be accessed later by the user or other users, or it may be used by the server  \n",
    "\n",
    " * **File Upload Parameters in The HTTP Request :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **File Name ```(filename)``` :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * The original name of the file as uploaded by the user \n",
    "         \n",
    "         * can be used to save the file with its original name or to process it (Validating allowed file type) \n",
    "         \n",
    "         * **Example :** ```filename=\"ProfilePic.jpg\"``` \n",

    "\n",
    "         * Specifies the MIME type of the file being uploaded\n",
    "\n",
    "         * server uses this information to understand the type of file being uploaded and to enforce restrictions on allowed file types\n",

    "\n",
    " * **```File Upload Vulnerability occurs when an application allows users to upload files but fails to properly validate or restrict what is uploaded```**\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Impact :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * If the server executes or processes the uploaded file without adequate security checks, it may lead to RCE, privilege escalation, or even a full takeover of the server\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Common Scenarios lead to Harmful File Uploading :**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Lack of File Type Validation :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * The server might allow files with any extension, enabling attackers to upload potentially malicious executable files **```.php```** , **```.exe```** \n",
    "\n",
    "     * **MIME Type Forgery :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * Attackers might manipulate the MIME type of the uploaded file to make it appear harmless **```pretending a PHP script is an image```**    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Lack of Content Validation :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * The content of the file is not inspected, so a malicious script may be uploaded even if it has a benign-looking extension  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **No File Size Limit :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Attackers could upload extremely large files, which might cause denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting server resources\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Insecure File Storage Location :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * If uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible location, attackers can access them and trigger malicious actions             \n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Mitigation Techniques :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **File Type Validation :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Strictly enforce allowed file types (e.g., only images with .jpg, .png extensions). Use a whitelist approach instead of a blacklist\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Content Inspection :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Ensure the content of the file matches its expected format. For example, an image (.png) file should begin with The Magic Number **```.PNG....```**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Rename Uploaded Files :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Avoid using user-supplied filenames. Rename the file to something random and unique upon upload to avoid file execution issues    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Secure File Storage :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Store uploaded files in a directory that is not web-accessible. Ensure that files cannot be executed even if they are uploaded    \n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Limit File Size :** \n",
    "     \n",
    "         * Restrict the size of uploaded files to prevent denial-of-service attacks.     \n",

    "# **Bypassing Techniques for Mitigation Techniques :**\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Bypassing Black-Listing :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Try Uncommon Alternative Extensions :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * For Example .php Extension Has a lot of Alternatives ( .pht - phtml - phar - inc - phps - phpt - pgif - phtm)  all of These Extension Treated as .php Extension \n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Change Alphabet Case :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * The Server May be Just Forbidding .php extension only , But it Doesn't overlook case variations like .PHp or .Php     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Bypassing White-Listing :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Double Extension Bypass :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * Involves adding multiple extensions to a file name, where the first extension is allowed by the server, and the second is the actual malicious extension **```FileName.AllowedEx.NotAllowedEx```**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :** **```image.jpg.php```** when the file is executed, the server could treat it as a .php\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **NULL Byte Bypass :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * his exploit uses a null byte (%00 or \\x00), which in some programming languages or older systems can terminate strings, tricking the system into ignoring everything after the null byte **```FileName.NotAllowedEx%00.AllowedEx```**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :** \n",
    "         \n",
    "             * **```script.php%00.jpg```** systems may only see script.php, ignoring the rest of the name. This can allow the execution of the PHP file despite the server believing it's an image\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **Changing Content-Type Header :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * involves modifying the Content-Type header in the upload request to make the server believe the file is a different type than it actually is\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Example :** \n",
    "\n",
    "             * A malicious file like script.php is uploaded with the **```Content-Type: image/jpeg```** , If the server only checks the Content-Type header and not the actual content of the file, it may mistakenly allow the upload of a file that should be blocked         \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Tampering with Magic Numbers :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Attackers can manipulate a file's magic number to match a format that the server accepts, while the actual file content remains malicious\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * attacker could prepend the magic number of a valid image format (e.g., PNG) to a PHP file, tricking the server into accepting it as an image\n",
