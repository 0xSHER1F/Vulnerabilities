    "# **SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) :**\n",
    "\n",
    " * ```vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate a server into making requests to unintended locations (tricking a server into visiting a website of the attacker's choice)```\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * There is a Website that allows users to share links, Attacker can inject a URL pointing to an internal server instead of a public link . If the website fetches the content of the shared link, it might unintentionally reveal internal information or even allow the attacker to execute commands on the internal server \n",

    " * **SSRF Types :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) **Regular SSRF :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Application returns the entire response of the forged request to the attacker\n",
    "\n",
    "      2) **Blind SSRF :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Application doesn't return the entire response of the forged request. Instead, it might indicate success or failure, or provide no feedback at all       \n",

    "     1) **Input Validation and Sanitization :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **Forbid unnecessary Internal Requests :**\n",
    "\n",
    "     3) **Whitelisting and Blacklisting :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Blacklisting :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Block access to known threat sources\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Whitelisting :**\n",
    "\n",
    "             * Only permit requests to specific, trusted domains\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Whitelisting is generally more secure than blacklisting, as it's harder for attackers to bypass**\n",
    "\n",
    "     4) **Network Restrictions :** \n",
    "\n",
    "         * **Utilize firewalls :** Implement network-level firewalls to control traffic\n",

    "     5) **Defense in Depth :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Employ multiple layers of protection\n",

    "     6) **Regular review :** \n",

    "\n",
    "         * Using different IP address representations (decimal, hexadecimal, octal) can bypass filters \n",
    "\n",
    "     2) **URL Encoding :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Encoding special characters can sometimes bypass input validation\n",

    "     3) **Protocol Manipulation :**\n",
    "\n",
    "         * Trying different protocols (ftp, file, gopher) might bypass restrictions   \n",
